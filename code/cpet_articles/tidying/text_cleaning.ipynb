training (sit) rapidly improves cardio-respiratory fitness but demands less \\n\\ntraining time and volume than traditional endurance training. while the health and fitness \\n\\nbenefits caused by sit have received considerable research focus, the effect of short-term \\n\\nsit on 5 km run performance is unknown. thirty healthy untrained participants (aged 18–25 \\n\\nyears) were allocated to a control (n = 10) or a sit (n = 20) group. sit involved three to \\n\\neight sprints at maximal intensity, three times a week for four weeks. sprints were progressed \\n\\nto eight by the 12th session. all participants completed a 5 km time-trial on a public running \\n\\ntrack and an incremental treadmill test in an exercise physiology laboratory to determine 5 \\n\\nkm run performance and maximum oxygen uptake, respectively, before and after the four \\n\\nweek intervention. relative to the controls, sprint interval trained participants improved 5 km \\n\\nrun performance by 4.5% (p < 0.001) and this was accompanied by improvements in absolute \\n\\nand relative maximum oxygen uptake (4.9%, p = 0.04 and 4.5%, p = 0.045, respectively). \\n\\ntherefore, short-term sit significantly improves 5 km run performance in untrained young \\n\\nmen. we believe sit is a time-efficient means of improving cardio-respiratory fitness and 5 \\n\\nkm endurance performance. \\n\\n55 \\n\\n \\n\\n56

\\n\\n82 \\n\\n83 \\n\\n84 \\n\\nendurance run performance is important for individuals of average cardio-respiratory fitness \\n\\nwho aspire to improve their fitness and performance quickly and efficiently. moreover, \\n\\nconsidering the importance of cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance in ball \\n\\nsports such as soccer, australian rules football and cricket (5, 15, 18) there is immense \\n\\ncoaching emphasis on reducing training load to minimise injury risk, but maximise training \\n\\ntime to focus on other skills important to the sport. sit is an alternative mode of training to \\n\\ntraditional constant-rate training as sit improves cardio-respiratory fitness to a similar \\n\\ndegree as constant-rate training but requires 90% less weekly energy expenditure and 66% \\n\\nless total training time (7).  \\n\\ntypically sit consists of short, maximal efforts of 15–30 s, repeated several times \\n\\ninterspersed with 3–5 mins of recovery. indeed, sit may be more effective at improving \\n\\nendurance performance than both continuous running and other high-intensity interval \\n\\ntraining (hit) programmes. for example, 20 individuals who completed seven to twelve \\n\\nefforts of 30 s sprints thrice weekly for six weeks, improved 3 km run performance greater \\n\\nthan individuals who completed constant rate running or four to six four minute efforts at 3 \\n\\nkm average running velocity, over six weeks (4). others have, however, demonstrated \\n\\nrecreationally active participants similarly improve 2 km run performance after either six \\n\\nweeks of sit (4.6%) or constant rate running (5.9%) (13). therefore, sit seems to enhance \\n\\nrun performance over 2-3 km after six weeks of training, but whether these endurance \\n\\nbenefits improve run performance in untrained participants in shorter time-frames and over \\n\\ndistances exceeding 3 km (a distance requiring greater reliance on aerobic metabolism) is \\n\\nunknown. furthermore, the lack of inclusion of experimental controls in previous studies (4, \\n\\n6, 13) obfuscates the genuine impact of sit on endurance run performance.  \\n\\n

whether a novel and relatively short-\\n\\nterm (four week), thrice weekly sit programme improves cardio-respiratory fitness and 5 km \\n\\nrun performance. to that end, we assessed 5 km run performance and v̇ o2max before and after \\n\\neither a novel four week sit (four to eight 30-s maximal sprints, thrice weekly) programme \\n\\nfor cases (n = 20), or no training for controls (n =

\\n\\n173 \\n\\n174 \\n\\nthe purpose of our study was to determine whether a novel and short-term (four week), thrice \\n\\nweekly sit programme improves cardio-respiratory fitness and 5 km run performance in \\n\\nuntrained males. to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that 5 km run \\n\\nperformance is significantly improved following short-term (four weeks), low-volume sit. \\n\\nconsidering the marginal but not statistically significant improvement in the controls (31 s, \\n\\n2%), the marked (96 s, 6.5%) improvement after four weeks of sit translated to a mean 65 s \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0csit improves 5 km run performance \\n\\n9 \\n\\n(4.4%) faster 5 km run performance in cases. notably, 5 km run performance was improved \\n\\nin conjunction with increased v̇ o2max (4.5%). \\n\\n \\n\\nour data showing sit enhances 5 km run performance corroborates others’ showing sit \\n\\nenhances 2 km (13) and 3 km (4, 6) run performance in recreationally trained individuals. we \\n\\nare the first to demonstrate four weeks of three times per week sit, in the form of running, \\n\\nsignificantly improves 5 km run performance – a prestigious and olympic running distance. \\n\\ninterestingly, the impact of sit on 5 km endurance performance is established in other \\n\\nexercise modalities. a short-term (two-week) cycle sit intervention improved 5 km cycle \\n\\nperformance to a similar magnitude to our protocol (5.2%) (10). whether sit improves run \\n\\nperformance over longer distances warrants attention. additionally, whether sit benefits \\n\\nalready well-trained runners is yet to be fully understood, as data has, to date, been equivocal \\n\\n(1, 11). nevertheless, we verify sit as an effective means of improving running endurance \\n\\nperformance in untrained young men.  \\n\\n175 \\n\\n176 \\n\\n177 \\n\\n178 \\n\\n179 \\n\\n180 \\n\\n181 \\n\\n182 \\n\\n183 \\n\\n184 \\n\\n185 \\n\\n186 \\n\\n187 \\n\\n188 \\n\\n189 \\n\\n

after traditional constant-rate endurance training. it was reported, an \\n\\nintervention of three running sessions per week at 75% of v̇ o2max for six weeks improved 5 \\n\\nkm run time by approximately 80 s (~5%) in 39 untrained individuals (20). additionally, \\n\\nothers have shown 5 km time-trial improved by 78 s (5%) in a group that ran for 20 mins \\n\\nthree times per week for six weeks, initially starting at 0.8 km.hr-1 below their individual \\n\\nlactate threshold speed with progression to 0.8 km.hr-1 above their individual pre-training \\n\\nlactate threshold speed (14). importantly, a control group was not included in these studies to \\n\\nestablish the error of the 5 km time-trial test, which we established was 31 s. collectively, it \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0csit improves 5 km run performance \\n\\n10 \\n\\nappears sit improves 5 km run performance to a similar extent as constant-rate training, but \\n\\nin a quicker time frame (four vs. six weeks) and a smaller training duration (249 mins vs. 360 \\n\\nmins) (14).  \\n\\n199 \\n\\n200 \\n\\n201 \\n\\n202 \\n\\n \\n\\n203 \\n\\n204 \\n\\n205 \\n\\n206 \\n\\n207 \\n\\n208 \\n\\n209 \\n\\n210 \\n\\n211 \\n\\n212 \\n\\n213 \\n\\n214 \\n\\n215 \\n\\n216 \\n\\n217 \\n\\n218 \\n\\n219 \\n\\n220 \\n\\n221 \\n\\n222 \\n\\nshowed marked improvements in their participants lactate threshold, which could have \\n\\ncontributed to the improvements in run performance (14, 20), particularly because not all \\n\\nthe improvement in run performance was accompanied by a corresponding improvement in \\n\\nv̇ o2max. although previous constant-rate training studies have demonstrated participants \\nincreased their v̇ o2max to a similar magnitude observed in the our study (3.8–7.7%), they also \\ncases had improvements to v̇ o2max. alternatively, an improvement in cardiac output may \\noxidative capability, based on the concepts v̇ o2max is chiefly governed by the maximal \\n\\nhave facilitated the improvement in 5 km run speed, as opposed to improvements in muscle \\n\\ncardiac output and the lactate threshold by muscle oxidative capability (12). other \\n\\nmechanisms by which sit may enhance 5 km run performance include improved run \\n\\neconomy, running mechanics and potassium regulation. it was previously reported that \\n\\nmoderately-trained runners’ run economy was improved by 7% after four weeks of sit, but \\n\\nthese subject did not improve their 10 km time-trial performance (11). moreover, increases in \\n\\nknee flexor endurance, coupled with decreases in knee flexion torque and knee \\n\\nflexion/extension ratios are also adaptations associated with sprint training that could have \\n\\ncontributed to the improvement in 5 km run performance observed in our study (19). others \\n\\nhave shown in well-trained runners, sit enhanced key components of the na+/k+ pump that \\n\\nwould aid to minimise disturbances in nerve membrane potential and maintain sprint \\n\\nperformance, and this was associated with an approximate 3% improvement in 3 km and \\n\\n10km run performance (1). the increase in muscle oxidative and anaerobic enzyme activity \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0csit improves 5 km run performance \\n\\n11 \\n\\n223 \\n\\n224 \\n\\nare adaptations gained from sit and is another possible mechanism for the facilitated \\n\\nendurance performance observed in participants from our study (2, 3, 8, 16).  \\n\\n225 \\n\\n \\n\\n226 \\n\\n227 \\n\\n228 \\n\\n229 \\n\\n230 \\n\\n231 \\n\\na limitation of our study is that we did not include females. some of the benefits gained from \\n\\nsit seem to be dependent of gender. for example, males had greater muscle protein synthesis \\n\\nof proteins important for mitochondrial biogenesis after nine sessions of sit compared to \\n\\ntheir female counterparts (17). given these muscle adaptations are vital for endurance \\n\\nperformance (2, 8, 9), whether short-term sit improves 5 km run performance in females is \\n\\nleft for future investigations. \\n\\n232 \\n\\n \\n\\n233 \\n\\n234 \\n\\n235 \\n\\n236 \\n\\n237 \\n\\n238 \\n\\n239 \\n\\n240 \\n\\n241 \\n\\n242 \\n\\n243 \\n\\n244 \\n\\nfuture research could focus on optimising training variables, such as the recovery time \\n\\nbetween sprints, number of sprint repetitions, time required of each sprint, number of sessions \\n\\nrequired per week and the optimal length of sit to improve fitness and performance. in fact, \\n\\nthe efficiency of hit in evoking positive adaptations may even be more potent than \\n\\noriginally envisaged. it was recently revealed one maximal 4-min effort at 90% of heart rate \\n\\nmaximum on a cycle ergometer, performed three times a week for 10 weeks improves v̇ o2max \\n\\nby an average of 10% (21). \\n\\nin conclusion our data reveals sit is a highly effective strategy to improve endurance \\n\\nrunning quickly in previously untrained young men. \\n\\n \\n\\n

\\n\\n255 \\n\\n256 \\n\\n257 \\n\\nphysical conditioning professionals must be aware of efficient means of exercise training that \\n\\naugment cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. the results from our study \\n\\nsupport the use of short-term, low-volume sit as an effective means for rapidly improving \\n\\ncardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. therefore, team sport coaches should \\n\\nconsider incorporating short-term sit within periodised programmes to improve athlete \\n\\nendurance performance quickly and also to prevent musculoskeletal overuse injuries – a risk \\n\\nassociated with traditional forms of exercise that rely on large training volumes to improve \\n\\nendurance performance. what is more, sit has an added advantage of

       "\" 95 experimental approach to the problem 96 97 98 99 100 101 this study is a controlled trial, where healthy participants performed either four weeks of sit or no training, to evaluate the effect of sit on 5 km run performance and v̇ o2max. v̇ o2max was measured during a maximal treadmill test conducted in the university exercise physiology laboratory and the 5 km time-trial was assessed at a public running track. these tests were performed on separate days within one week of commencing the initial sit session and within one week after the final sit session. 102 103 subjects 104 105 106 thirty, apparently healthy young men (18–25 years) were recruited for this study. participants were initially screened to ensure they were not currently engaging in any structured high-intensity aerobic exercise training. all participants had not completed any sit improves 5 km run performance 6 107 108 structured aerobic exercise training in the past year. twenty participants were allocated to the sit (cases) group and 10 participants were allocated to the control group. 109 110 111 participants gave written informed consent and this study was approved by the university’s human research ethics committee. 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 procedures participant v̇ o2max was assessed during a maximal treadmill test, by pulmonary analysis conducted in an exercise physiology laboratory at the university. before the v̇ o2max test participants were fitted with a two-way breathing valve (hans rudolph) and expired air was collected into an online metabolic system (moxus) for gas (o2 and co2) analysis. the metabolic system was calibrated before each test using ambient air and gas of known test commenced at 10 km.h-1, and treadmill speed was progressively increased by 1 km.h-1 composition. participants were given a standardised 3-min warm-up at 10 km.h-1. the v̇ o2max every second minute until volitional exhaustion. v̇ o2max was determined as the highest o2 morning of testing. within a week of the v̇ o2max assessment each participant completed a value averaged over 60-s. all laboratory testing was performed preprandially at the same time of day (8–10 am). participants were encouraged to hydrate the night before and supervised 5 km run time-trial on a flat running track in a local park. participants were familiar with 5 km circuit and were advised to hydrate before running. all testing was conducted in the afternoon (4–6 pm). briefly, participants completed a short 10-min warm- up including some light aerobic exercise and dynamic stretches. participants were supervised and instructed to run maximally at their own pace. sit improves 5 km run performance 7 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 cases completed a standardised sit programme performed three times a week over four weeks (total of 12 sessions). the sprint duration and recovery period was controlled at 30-s and 4-mins (passive), respectively. participants were requested to run maximally without pacing for each 30-s sprint. all training was conducted on the university’s sports oval and an accredited exercise physiologist (with exercise and sport science australia) provided participants with verbal encouragement, and supervised each training session. the sit volume increased from four to eight sprints over the four week intervention (table 1). before each training session, participants completed a standardised warm-up entailing a 5-min aerobic warm-up, dynamic stretches and some short (20 m) runs at approximately 70, 80, 90 and 100% effort. <<table 1 about here>> all participants were instructed not to deviate from their current physical activity, exercise (if any) and dietary habits during the four week intervention period. 144 statistical analyses 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows (version 20, ibm corp, armonk, ny). data were tested for normality using the kolmogorov-smirnov and shapiro-wilk tests, and non-parametric data was log-transformed before further analysis. paired samples t-tests were used to examine fitness and performance changes after sit, relative to the control group. to ascertain the test-retest reliability of vo2max and 5 km time- trial performance, the intraclass correlation coefficient (2, k), coefficient of variation (log- transformed), standard error of measurement, and systematic bias (determined by paired samples t-test) were calculated. significance was set at p < 0.05. sit improves 5 km run performance 8 153 results 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 test-retest reliability data is outlined in table 2. the 5 km time-trial test had excellent reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99 and a 3.4% coefficient of variation. <<table 2 about here>> figure 1 outlines the fitness and performance changes after four weeks of sit. relative to the control group who showed a marginal increase in 5 km time-trial performance (mean ± sd: 1478 ± 350 to 1447 ± 347, -2%, p = 0.20, table 2 and figure 1), cases had a significant improvement in 5 km time-trial performance by an average of 65 s (mean ± sd: 1464 ± 298 to 1368 ± 270, -4.4%, p < 0.001) following four weeks of sit (figure 1). while absolute and relative v̇ o2max increased after sit in cases (mean ± sd: 3.8 ± 0.6 to 4.0 ± 0.6, 4.9%, p = 0.04 and 49.6 ± 4.6 to 51.4 ± 3.8, 4.5%, p = 0.045, respectively), absolute and relative v̇ o2max were unchanged in controls (mean ± sd: 3.7 ± 0.6 to 3.7 ± 0.6, 0.6%, p = 0.73 and 49.6 ± 6.7 to 49.3 ± 6.7 -0.6%, p = 0.72, respectively, table 2 and figure 1). <<figure 1 about here>> 168 discussion 169 170 171 172 173 174 the purpose of our study was to determine whether a novel and short-term (four week), thrice weekly sit programme improves cardio-respiratory fitness and 5 km run performance in untrained males. to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that 5 km run performance is significantly improved following short-term (four weeks), low-volume sit. considering the marginal but not statistically significant improvement in the controls (31 s, 2%), the marked (96 s, 6.5%) improvement after four weeks of sit translated to a mean 65 s sit improves 5 km run performance 9 (4.4%) faster 5 km run performance in cases. notably, 5 km run performance was improved in conjunction with increased v̇ o2max (4.5%). our data showing sit enhances 5 km run performance corroborates others’ showing sit enhances 2 km (13) and 3 km (4, 6) run performance in recreationally trained individuals. we are the first to demonstrate four weeks of three times per week sit, in the form of running, significantly improves 5 km run performance – a prestigious and olympic running distance. interestingly, the impact of sit on 5 km endurance performance is established in other exercise modalities. a short-term (two-week) cycle sit intervention improved 5 km cycle performance to a similar magnitude to our protocol (5.2%) (10). whether sit improves run performance over longer distances warrants attention. additionally, whether sit benefits already well-trained runners is yet to be fully understood, as data has, to date, been equivocal (1, 11). nevertheless, we verify sit as an effective means of improving running endurance performance in untrained young men. 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 the increased 5 km run performance in our study is similar to previously observed improvements after traditional constant-rate endurance training. it was reported, an intervention of three running sessions per week at 75% of v̇ o2max for six weeks improved 5 km run time by approximately 80 s (~5%) in 39 untrained individuals (20). additionally, others have shown 5 km time-trial improved by 78 s (5%) in a group that ran for 20 mins three times per week for six weeks, initially starting at 0.8 km.hr-1 below their individual lactate threshold speed with progression to 0.8 km.hr-1 above their individual pre-training lactate threshold speed (14). importantly, a control group was not included in these studies to establish the error of the 5 km time-trial test, which we established was 31 s. collectively, it sit improves 5 km run performance 10 appears sit improves 5 km run performance to a similar extent as constant-rate training, but in a quicker time frame (four vs. six weeks) and a smaller training duration (249 mins vs. 360 mins) (14). 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 showed marked improvements in their participants lactate threshold, which could have contributed to the improvements in run performance (14, 20), particularly because not all the improvement in run performance was accompanied by a corresponding improvement in v̇ o2max. although previous constant-rate training studies have demonstrated participants increased their v̇ o2max to a similar magnitude observed in the our study (3.8–7.7%), they also cases had improvements to v̇ o2max. alternatively, an improvement in cardiac output may oxidative capability, based on the concepts v̇ o2max is chiefly governed by the maximal have facilitated the improvement in 5 km run speed, as opposed to improvements in muscle cardiac output and the lactate threshold by muscle oxidative capability (12). other mechanisms by which sit may enhance 5 km run performance include improved run economy, running mechanics and potassium regulation. it was previously reported that moderately-trained runners’ run economy was improved by 7% after four weeks of sit, but these subject did not improve their 10 km time-trial performance (11). moreover, increases in knee flexor endurance, coupled with decreases in knee flexion torque and knee flexion/extension ratios are also adaptations associated with sprint training that could have contributed to the improvement in 5 km run performance observed in our study (19). others have shown in well-trained runners, sit enhanced key components of the na+/k+ pump that would aid to minimise disturbances in nerve membrane potential and maintain sprint performance, and this was associated with an approximate 3% improvement in 3 km and 10km run performance (1). the increase in muscle oxidative and anaerobic enzyme activity sit improves 5 km run performance 11 223 224 are adaptations gained from sit and is another possible mechanism for the facilitated endurance performance observed in participants from our study (2, 3, 8, 16). 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 a limitation of our study is that we did not include females. some of the benefits gained from sit seem to be dependent of gender. for example, males had greater muscle protein synthesis of proteins important for mitochondrial biogenesis after nine sessions of sit compared to their female counterparts (17). given these muscle adaptations are vital for endurance performance (2, 8, 9), whether short-term sit improves 5 km run performance in females is left for future investigations. 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 future research could focus on optimising training variables, such as the recovery time between sprints, number of sprint repetitions, time required of each sprint, number of sessions required per week and the optimal length of sit to improve fitness and performance. in fact, the efficiency of hit in evoking positive adaptations may even be more potent than originally envisaged. it was recently revealed one maximal 4-min effort at 90% of heart rate maximum on a cycle ergometer, performed three times a week for 10 weeks improves v̇ o2max by an average of 10% (21). in conclusion our data reveals sit is a highly effective strategy to improve endurance running quickly in previously untrained young men. sit improves 5 km run performance 12 245 practical applications 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 physical conditioning professionals must be aware of efficient means of exercise training that augment cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. the results from our study support the use of short-term, low-volume sit as an effective means for rapidly improving cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. therefore, team sport coaches should consider incorporating short-term sit within periodised programmes to improve athlete endurance performance quickly and also to prevent musculoskeletal overuse injuries – a risk associated with traditional forms of exercise that rely on large training volumes to improve endurance performance. what is more, sit has an added advantage of simultaneously enhancing anaerobic qualities required in team sports. finally, sit should be encouraged to individuals who perceive time as an obstacle to exercising, as four weeks of thrice weekly sit consisting of four to eight 30-s sprints (just over 4 hrs of total exercise, including rest periods) quickly enhances cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. 258 259 references 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 1. bangsbo j, gunnarsson tp, wendell j, nybo l, and thomassen m. reduced volume and increased training intensity elevate muscle
