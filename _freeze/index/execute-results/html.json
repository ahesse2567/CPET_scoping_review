@johnson1998; @sell2021; @midgley2007; @astorino2009; @astorino2000; @sousa2010; @martin-rincon2019; @martin-rincon2020; @scheadler2017; @dejesus2014; @hill2003; @smart2015; @matthews1987; @robergs2003; @robergs2010].\nHowever, there is scarce information on data averaging and its effect on ventilatory threshold identification.Many studies remove outliers by finding points ±3 or ±4 standard deviations (SD) beyond the local mean (i.e., a prediction interval).\nThese cutoffs are common because the relatively small sample size of breath-by-breath gas exchange data often contains more values beyond 3 or 4 SD than one would predict from an assumed Gaussian distribution [@lamarra1987].\nMore outliers appear than expected because of \"swallowing, coughing, or premature ending of the breath for some other reason\" [@lamarra1987].\nWe are unaware of prior research that examines how different outlier removal strategies affect VO2max or ventilatory thresholds.Gas exchange data interpolation is primarily used to distribute data points uniformly, often to one-second intervals.\nThis procedure is more common with VO\\~2\\~ kinetics analyses because it allows for repeated transitions between easier and harder exercise bouts to be \"ensemble\" averaged by superposition [@keir2014; @lamarra1987].\nWithin VO\\~2\\~ kinetics research, the practice of linearly interpolating data every one second has been criticized because it artificially narrows confidence intervals [@benson2017; @francescato2014; @francescato2019; @francescato2015].\nSince ventilation frequency at the beginning of a graded exercise test is approximately 0.2 Hz, interpolating to every one second adds dependent data points that do not represent an independent reading by the gas analyzer and flow sensor.\nThis increases the sample size without adding independent readings and thus artificially narrows the confidence intervals of parameter estimates in VO\\~2\\~ kinetics analyses.\nAs before, we are unaware of research specifically investigating how interpolation affects VO2max and ventilatory threshold identification.Therefore, some evidence suggests that data preprocessing choices, such as outlier removal and interpolation, can significantly impact the CPET variables calculated.\nHowever, we are unaware of research investigating the effect of data preprocessing on ventilatory threshold identification.\nSome research has already surveyed reported data averaging in peer-reviewed journals [@midgley2007] and via survey [@robergs2010], with the major finding that time-based bin averages (see @sec-methods for details) were the most popular averaging methods.\nHowever, these two studies were rather small in scale.\nTherefore, to assist with conducting research on the effects of data preprocessing on CPET values and to evaluate the methodological reproducibility of research using breath-by-breath gas exchange data generally, a broad scoping review proves useful in identifying the prevalence and popularity of outlier removal, interpolation, and data averaging methods.\n\n## Methods {#sec-methods}\n\n<!-- Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline). -->\n\n<!-- Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year.
