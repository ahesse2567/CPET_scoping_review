During the incremental exercise, the pulmonary V Àô O2max attained was taken as the highest 15-breath rolling average value attained. An identical procedure was employed on the Tlim tests for the determination of peak V Àô O2 and its associated heart rate (HR) and V Àô E. To avoid being influenced by the amount of data used in the comparison between the control and IPC conditions, the V Àô O2 onset kinetics were analyzed by fixing the time window to the shortest Tlim recorded for each subject (i.e., isotime). The breath-by-breath data were first linearly interpolated to provide second-by-second values, and, for each individual, identical repetitions were time-aligned to the start of exercise, and the ensemble was averaged.

[35]. V‚ÄôO2 responses from the bouts of repeated exercises were time-aligned to the onset of the exercise and interpolated on a second-by-second basis. The resulting data were then, for each subject, superimposed, averaged over the transitions of the exercise and, finally, averaged over consecutive 10 s time intervals, as in, e.g., Ref. [36], in order to reduce the noise.
