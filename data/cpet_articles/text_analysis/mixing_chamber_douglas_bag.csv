taylor et al. 1955; mitchell et al. 1958;', ' a˚ strand and saltin 1961; saltin and a˚ strand 1967; a˚ strand and rodahl 1986). consequently, numerous of authors recommend the DOUGLAS BAG technique as the criterion method for these determinations (casaburi et al. 2003;

therefore, the volume of expired air sampled by the DOUGLAS-BAG method was increased by 0.25 l·min–1 of collection time. correcting the DOUGLAS BAGs’ expired volume for this loss of air increased the o2 uptake by ≈11 ml·min–1 (8 µmol·s–1; + 0.5% ± 0.2%). consequently, despite the small difference, only data corrected for this loss of volume have been used in further comparisons. to allow proper comparison of data from the moxus and DOUGLAS-BAG methods, only data from the moxus system averaged over the last minute of each 5-min period have been used. raw data of the moxus output, i.e., fractions of o2 and co2 in both inspired and expired air together with air pressure and temperature, were', ' vol. 37, 2012 fig. 3.

has the advantage, when compared to conventional systems using the DOUGLAS BAG technique or MIXING CHAMBERs, that it allows measurement of respiratory variables during the non-steady state phase of exercise. in addition, the determination of end-tidal po2 and end-tidal pco2 may be useful in identifying the ventilatory anaerobic threshold more accurately and may detect hypoventilation or hyperventilation.4 in the present study, respiratory variables calculated by the breath-by-breath method, were compared with those obtained by the DOUGLAS BAG technique, which was considered as the reference method. it should be realized, however, that even this system is not without potential error. the meteorologic balloons are slightly permeable for o2 and co2. the diffusion has been found to be less t', 'ratory volumes has been found to be ± 2 percent of readings performed by a tissot spirometer.17 finally, the timing of the collection period for the DOUGLAS BAG system may have differed slightly from the average breath-by-breath values. since the expired air was directed to the DOUGLAS BAGs for exactly 1-min periods, incomplete breathing cycles may have been collected. for the breath-by-breath system, only ', 'complete respiratory cycles were time-averaged within a 1-min period. the validity of the breath-by-breath analysis has been assessed in healthy adults by comparison with simultaneously measured values obtained by conventional methods (DOUGLAS BAG system or MIXING CHAMBER). in these experiments, correlation coefficients higher than 0.98 have been reported.1, 2, 4 in other validation studies between both systems, comparisons were made with published normal values7 or with conventional system, but measured on a separat', 'ich was not the case. another source of error could be the stability of the flow meter used for the measurement of the volumes of the DOUGLAS BAGs. it appeared that the flow meter (rotating vane) used, was flow-dependent when a calibration
